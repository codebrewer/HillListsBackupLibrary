# Hill Lists Backup Library

## About

**Hill Lists Backup Library** is a Swift library that provides read-only access
to backup files exported by the [Hill Lists](https://grahamhaley.co.uk/hills/)
iOS app available for iPhone and iPad from the
[App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hill-lists/id315200683).

**Hill Lists** is an iOS app for hill walkers in Britain and Ireland, highly
recommended as a source of hill-related information and for recording, tracking
and visualising hill-bagging progress.

App users interested in examining their data are likely to be better served by
the app's CSV export feature than by this library. While a backup file contains
the app's configuration settings, the identifiers of tracked lists, the
identifiers of ascended hills and the dates and recorded notes of any ascents,
the CSV export provides immediately usable hill-related information such as
name, location and height.

## Motivation

The library is motivated by a desire to learn the Swift programming language and
how to build a reusable Swift library the "right" way. A concrete project is
often the best way to learn new skills. If the resulting library is useful to
anyone then that's a bonus.
